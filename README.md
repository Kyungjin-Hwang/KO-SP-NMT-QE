### Towards Improved Korean-Spanish Machine Translation: Dataset Construction and Utilization Strateges

[Scheduled in July, 2024](URL)

This dataset is aimed at evaluating machine translation from a linguistic perspective, focusing on lexicology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics, and information structure.

The dataset is divided into the following major categories by linguistic aspect (with no major categories for lexicology and information structure):

- **Morphology**: Internal structure of words, word formation
- **Syntax**: Constituents of sentences, types of sentences, word order of sentences
- **Pragmatics**: Pragmatics dataset, spoken and written text

Additionally, the dataset is subdivided into the categories as shown in the tables below.
