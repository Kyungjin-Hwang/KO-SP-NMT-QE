## BLI practice with KO-SP-NMT-QE dataset

We performed BLI using the ESKO dataset (KO-SP-NMT-QE dataset). A detailed description can be found in the paper on this dataset. 

#### Description.
We built BLI using pre-trained word embeddings and Multilingual Unsupervised and Supervised Embeddings (MUSE). This study first utilized Korean and Spanish embeddings from FastText (https://fasttext.cc), one of the pre-trained word embeddings. We then utilized MUSE's supervised learning to perform embedding mapping between the two languages. However, this requires a language dictionary between the two languages for training. In the case of Korean-Spanish, there is not enough data for such learning, so this study performed an indirect Korean-Spanish lexical mapping through English, with primary mapping of Korean-English and secondary mapping of English-Spanish. The Korean-English and English-Spanish language dictionaries used in this process were provided by MUSE on github. After completing the mapping, this study built a BLI utilizing the data set of this study. First, we loaded the dataset of this study, extracted words from each sentence, and embedded each word. Then, the embedding mapping obtained using MUSE was applied to convert the Korean embeddings to the Spanish embedding space. Then, we built BLI by finding the most similar words using the converted embeddings and saved them in a csv file for further utilization.
